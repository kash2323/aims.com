			<p>
				Grounded in Miami University's tradition of liberal education, AIMS represents the liberal arts of the 21st century, providing a foundation in information and digital literacy, from multimedia authorship/critical theory to digital and social media marketing, from app development to code-based art, from game studies to user-experience design, and more. This grounding is then complemented with a focused area of depth in one of many areas of scholarly interest in IMS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, AIMS graduates are highly sought after by both employers and graduate schools. Graduates are currently employed by everything from innovative startups like Uber to established agencies like Rockfish to consumer product development like P&G. AIMS games students go on to work for Microsoft Studios, Nintendo, Oblong Industries, ZooGames/IndiePub, and Zynga. Mid-career games alumni have experience at Rockstar Vancouver and Lucas Arts.
